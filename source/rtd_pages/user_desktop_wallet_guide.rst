Desktop Wallet User Guide
=========================

Using Beam Dekstop Wallet is the simplest way to start using Beam. It is available for Linux, Mac and Windows platforms (see :ref:`supported platforms` for details). 


Downloading Binaries
--------------------

Proceed to the download page of Beam official website: https://beam.mw/downloads


Ensure that the communication between your browser and Beam official website is encrypted by verifying that the padlock icon is displayed in its locked state  

.. figure:: images/ssl_lock.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: SSL

Download the desktop wallet for your platform (Mac, Linux or Windows):

.. figure:: images/downloads.jpg
   :alt: Downloads page


.. attention:: If you receive a warning from your browser that the downloaded file may be malicious, make sure you are indeed downloading from beam.mw website and then ignore it.


Ensure that you’ve downloaded the untampered Wallet installation file by checking that the value generated by SHA256 is the same as announced on the Beam official site:

On Mac open terminal and run: 

::

   openssl sha256 <file>


On Linux run


On Windows, open Power Shell and type

::

   Get-FileHash 'C:\Users\bigromanov\Downloads\beam-node-1.0.3860.zip'


Substitute your own path instead of the one in the example above

.. warning:: As the wallet will be continuously updated, the actual version numbers and SHA values might be different from the screenshot at the moment of reading.


Installation

Where are the files
-------------------

When Desktop Wallet is installed the walelt data files are stored separately from the binaries. 

The locations of all the files are described here: :ref:`files and locations`


Creating new wallet
-------------------

One you launch the wallet for the first time, you will be suggested to either create a new wallet or restore from existing seed phrase

.. figure:: images/desktop/03_creating_new_wallet/01.jpg
   :alt: Choosing between new and restore


Click 'Create new wallet'. You will be prompted to generate the seed phrase.


Generating seed phrase
----------------------

As a part of creating new wallet, the new seed phrase will be generated for you.

.. attention:: Seed phrase is the **most important secret you have to keep**. Knowing the seed phrase enables you (or anyone else) to access all your funds. 


.. figure:: images/desktop/03_creating_new_wallet/02.jpg
   :alt: Before generating seed phrase


.. attention:: Seed phrase in the Beam wallet is *not* linked to email, phone number or any other identifier. You will need this phrase to restore your wallet, when you lose or reformat your device, or want to access your funds from your mobile phone or from another desktop or laptop. 


.. figure:: images/desktop/03_creating_new_wallet/03.jpg
   :alt: Generating seed phrase


.. attention:: Generating the seed phrase is **for your eyes only**! For the best security always do it on a clean air-gapped machine.


.. figure:: images/desktop/03_creating_new_wallet/04.jpg
   :alt: Keeping seed phrase safe warning

Did you wrote down your seed phrase correctly? Triple-check your handwriting again. The difference between '*f*unnel' and '*t*unnel' can be crucial when trying to restore a wallet with valuable funds in the far or near future.

Did you verified your handwriting? Now go find a safe space for the paper! 

.. note:: Storing the info on your computer makes your funds prone to cyber attacks (read: much less secure). Creative approaches like saving a screenshot of the wallet or your handwriting on your computer may sound like a good idea, but it is not recommended. If someone hacks into your computer, network drive etc; they can steal your recovery phrase. There are programs (called OCR) that can scan pictures and transform them to plain text. 

.. attention:: Always store your seed phrase in a safe and secure location (and better more than one in different geo locations). Write it on a piece of paper. Do not store electronically neither as plain text nor in any other form!

In order to ensure that you have really wrote down your seed phrase, the wallet will ask you to fill in the specific recovery words from your phrase in random order.

.. figure:: images/desktop/03_creating_new_wallet/05.jpg
   :alt: Repeat your seed phrase 

Only when you typed all the selected words correctly you will be allowed to proceed to the next step.

.. figure:: images/desktop/03_creating_new_wallet/06.jpg
   :alt: Indicate correct words 


Setting wallet password
-----------------------

To access your Beam Wallet, you will need to create a password. This password is not the same as the recovery phrase. Recovery phrase identifies a wallet and enables the access to all the funds stored in it from any device, wallet password provides with a complementary security layer in case someone gained access to your computer or has stolen your wallet database file. It is important to choose a strong password. 


.. figure:: images/desktop/03_creating_new_wallet/07.jpg
   :alt: Example of a weak password

Wallet Password protects your wallet in case someone has access to your computer or has stolen your wallet database file. It is important to choose strong password that you can remember. The wallet will provide some indication of password strength for your convenience. Do not count on it however. Choose password that is at least 8 symbols long with combination of characters from different types, such as letters numbers and special symbols

.. figure:: images/desktop/03_creating_new_wallet/08.jpg
   :alt: Example of a stronger password 


Choosing the node connectivity mode
-----------------------------------

Beam Desktop Wallet can be run in one of three modes.

To run an integrated node from within the wallet choose “Run integrated node (recommended)”. The trusted node will automatically verify the blockchain, hence it’s the recommended option. 

.. advanced:: When running behind a firewall you can change the default port the node will be listening on, and in case of CPU mining, set the amount of mining threads. You will be probably provided at least one default peer to connect to but you can always add more peers on the Settings screen. The recommended peers are published in the list of bootstrap nodes in the `downloads page <https://beam.mw/downloads>`_ on `Beam official website <https://beam.mw>`_.

.. figure:: images/desktop/03_creating_new_wallet/09.jpg
   :alt: Start wallet with integrated node  

Random mode allows you to automatically connect to random bootstrap node. In this mode Beam Wallet acts like a ‘light client’, it will create transactions but will have to trust the remote node for blockchain verification. It is recommended for lighter devices (with limited CPU power and/or RAM memory).

.. figure:: images/desktop/03_creating_new_wallet/10.jpg
   :alt: Start wallet with random mode  


If you are running your own node somewhere (or maybe even more than one) and want to connect specifically to it, use the third option by providing the IP and port the node is listening on.

.. figure:: images/desktop/03_creating_new_wallet/11.jpg
   :alt: Start wallet with specific remote node  

Synchronizing the wallet
------------------------

Once the Wallet is connected, it synchronizes the current blockchain state from the network. Be patient when running with the integrated node: the data downloading process might take some time. The wallet will first download and validate the latest :ref: `macroblock` and then all the rest of the blockchain.

.. figure:: images/desktop/03_creating_new_wallet/12.jpg
   :alt: Synchronizing the wallet


Main Screen
-----------

Once your wallet is created, the main screen will show up. The screen usually opens up automatically when you enter the application and successfully submit the local password. 

.. figure:: images/desktop/04_main_screen/01.jpg
   :alt: Main screen

The Main Screen of the wallet shows the current balance of both available and unconfirmed BEAM as well as the transaction history and statuses. On the left, under the Beam logo, there is a toolbar that provides navigation between different wallet screens, currently: Wallet (or Main Screen), Addresses, UTXO and Settings.

In the top left corner of the Main Screen, under the screen title, you see connection status indicator which shows whether the wallet could successfully connect to the node. In brackets, it specifies the network to which the wallet is connected. In the screenshot above it says ‘(master)’ which means the wallet is connected to internal developers network, called “masternet”. In case of Testnet 4, it will say ‘(testnet4)’. For the main (production) network no name will be written. 

Green indicator means that the node is up and running. In case the wallet is unable to connect to the node, red indicator will appear.

Near ``online`` word a blockchain name the node is connected to might appear. In general, there are 3 networks:
* **Mainnet:** the actual production network. 
* **Testnet<number>:** (such as Testnet3, Testnet4 etc): staging environments for trying new features in our wallet, node and miner software. For advanced users only.
* **Masternet:** new features under development, if you see this name in your wallet it means that you are very early adopter or Beam code contributor otherwise you’ve probably arrived to the wrong place.

.. attention:: Since Mainnet is the default network for the vast majority of Beam users, nothing is written by the online status.

.. attention:: Unless you know what you are doing, please verify that nothing is written after ``online``.

.. figure:: images/desktop/desktop/04_main_screen/02.jpg
   :alt: Main screen

In the top left corner of the Main Screen, under the screen title, you see connection indicator which shows whether the wallet could successfully connect to peers. In brackets, it specifies the network to which the wallet is connected. In the screenshot above it says ``(master)`` which means the wallet is connected to internal developers network, called masternet. In case of Testnet 4, it will say ``(testnet4)``. If the wallet is unable to connect to the peer it will be shown by red indicator.

   :alt: Wallet disconnected  

'Send' and 'Receive' buttons at the top right corner help us to :ref: `Sending BEAM` and :ref: `Receiving BEAM`. Let's start using the wallet!

Receiving BEAM
--------------

Before starting to receive BEAM for the first time, please read first about what ref :address: is.

In a nutshell, here is how the process of receiving BEAM looks like from a Receiver’s perspective:
* Create an address (unless you’d like to reuse one that already exists, more on that later)
* Send your address to the Sender person **over a secure communication channel**
* Stay online when Sender will initiate the transaction

Create an address
-----------------

Proceed to the Main screen and click the blue 'Receive' button at the top right corner. Receive Dialog will open:

.. figure:: images/desktop/05_receiving_beam/01.jpg
   :alt: Receive BEAM dialog

Copy and paste the newly-generated Beam address to send it to the Sender over a **secure communication channel**. There are three ways to do it:
* By selecting the address and clicking ``Command-C`` or ``Ctrl-C`` (depending on your platform)
* By right-click on the address and choosing 'Copy' from the drop-down menu
* By clicking the 'Copy' button

.. figure:: images/desktop/05_receiving_beam/02.jpg
   :alt: Copy address

Each time the Receive Beam dialog is open, new Beam address is generated. By default, the address is valid for 24 hours. It is best to give the Sender your address closest to the time they will be sending beams so the address does not expire. 

.. figure:: images/desktop/05_receiving_beam/03.jpg
   :alt: Set address expiration


You can explicitly set the expiration time to ‘Never’ by selecting the value in the ‘Expires’ dropdown.

.. warning:: The permanent addresses that never expire are only useful in very limited special cases, like working with exchanges and such. For ultimate privacy, do not use this option for regular transactions, rather always create a new address for each transaction.

.. attention:: You have to click ‘Close’ button in the dialog for the address to become active

QR code
-------

If the Sender uses a mobile app he can scan the QR code directly from your laptop. The feature will be available soon in the upcoming Beam Wallet mobile app. 

.. figure:: images/desktop/05_receiving_beam/04.jpg
   :alt: QR code

Comment
-------

You also add a comment when creating the receiving address. The comment is never sent to the network, it is only visible inside your wallet and is used for internal bookkeeping only. 

The comment can be seen on the :ref: `address screen` and in the extended transaction view.

Sending the address
-------------------

.. attention:: When sending the address make sure you use a secure communication channel.

.. attention:: Make sure the entire address is sent to the Sender as it’s longer than it appears on the screen. Don’t forget to double check the value in whichever messenger app of your choice because viruses and malware on your computer may change your address while it’s in the clipboard. 

Completing the transaction
--------------------------

Once the Sender initiates the transaction, you will see a new Transaction appearing in the transaction list on the Main screen and the sending amount will appear on the 'In progress' panel. 

.. figure:: images/desktop/05_receiving_beam/05.jpg
   :alt: Incoming transaction

Normally, a transaction will pass through the following stages:
* **In Progress** - during the phase when transaction is being created by the wallets
* **Confirming** - after transaction was sent to the nodes but before it was mined
* **Completed** - after transaction was fully mined and confirmed

Once transaction is completed the Available balance will be updated and the 'In Progress' panel will disappear.

   :alt: BEAM received


Sending BEAM
------------

Before starting to send BEAM, please read first about what :ref: `address` is.

In a nutshell, here is how the process of sending BEAM looks like from a Sender’s perspective:
* Receive and address the funds should be sent to
* Send BEAM in the Beam wallet
* Stay online till Receiver confirms the transaction



Address Screen
--------------

Addresses screen lists all SBBS addresses that were used in transactions. It's main use is for managing your interactions with other wallets. Add data in this screen is only stored locally and is not related to the blockchain in any way. 

.. figure:: images/desktop/16_address_screen_default.png
   :alt: Address screen

Initially, one default listening address is created. Each address has a default expiration time of 24 hours, including the default address. You can always crete a new address using Receive dialog, as will be explained in the :ref: `Sending and Receiving Beams` section below.

.. attention:: It is highly recommended to create a new address for each transaction

You can explicitly delete the address by clicking on the three dots located to the right of the address and choosing 'Delete address' from the drop down menu

UTXO Screen
-----------

In Beam, like in most other cryptocurrencies, your balance is constructed as a result of transactions. Each Transaction uses some existing inputs and creates new outputs. All the outputs controlled by the wallet are shown in the UTXO screen.

.. figure:: images/desktop/17_utxo_screen_empty.png
   :alt: UTXO Screen

Settings screen
---------------

Settings screen currently consists of four sections

.. figure:: images/desktop/18_settings_local_node.png
   :alt: Address screen

The Remote Node section (top left) is relevant in case the wallet is connected to a remote node and specifies IP address and port of that node.

The Local Node section (bottom left) is relevant in case wallet runs local node. In that section you can enable or disable local node (in case local node is disabled wallet connects to a remote node specified in the Remote Node section). When running local node you should specify the port on which the node will be listening on and the list of node peers. 

General Settings section allows to change walelt password and set the lock screen time, after which wallet will automatically logout to protect against accidental unauthorized access to a running wallet

The Report problem section allows to create an archive of wallet logs and explains how to report an issue. It also shows the current location of the walelt files. See more details about reporting issues and getting support in the :ref: `Reporting Issues and Getting Support` section.

.. attention:: In case the wallet crashes at start or when trying to create the log archive please refer to :ref: `Troubleshooting` section.

In the top right corner of the Settings screen is the wallet version. It is important to always specify the version when asking for support or reporting issues.
