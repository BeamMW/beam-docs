Welcome to Beam's documentation!
================================


What is Beam?
--------------

`Beam <https://beam.mw/>`__ is a next generation scalable, confidential cryptocurrency based on an elegant and innovative `Mimblewimble protocol <https://scalingbitcoin.org/papers/mimblewimble.txt>`_.

Things that make BEAM special include:

* Users have complete control over privacy - a user decides which information will be available and to which parties, having complete control over his personal data in accordance to his will and applicable laws.

* Confidentiality without penalty - in BEAM confidential transactions do not cause bloating of the blockchain, avoiding excessive computational overhead or penalty on performance or scalability while completely concealing the transaction value.

* No trusted setup required.

* Blocks are mined using Equihash Proof-of-Work algorithm.

* Limited emission using periodic halving.

* No addresses are stored in the blockchain - no information whatsoever about either the sender or the receiver of a transaction is stored in the blockchain.

* Superior scalability through compact blockchain size using the “cut-through” feature of Mimblewimble.

* No premine. No ICO. Backed by a treasury, emitted from every block during the first five years.

* Implemented from scratch in C++.
