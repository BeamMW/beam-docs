Creating new wallet
-------------------

There are two ways of how user can create new wallet: ::ref:`Easy onboarding` and ::ref:`Create a new wallet with seed phrase`

.. _easy_onboarding: 

Easy onboarding
---------------

The easiest way. After installation and clicking on the button “Create new wallet”, a user can skip the step about verifying seed by clicking on “I will do it later”. Take a look at the following screenshots.

.. attention:: Seed phrase in the Beam wallet is *not* linked to email, phone number or any other identifier. You will need this phrase to restore your wallet when you lose or reformat your device, or want to access your funds from another device.

On the next step user needs to enter a password for his wallet and confirm it. This password is not the same as the seed phrase. Seed phrase identifies a wallet and enables access to all the funds stored in Beam blockchain from any device. Your wallet password provides with a second security layer in case someone gains access to your computer or has stolen your wallet database file.

It is important to choose a strong password. The wallet will provide some indication of password strength for your convenience. Do not count on it, however. Choose a password that is at least 8 characters long with a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.

It takes several seconds to create a new wallet.
